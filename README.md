# Twinkle Vim Config

A sufficiently good Vim configuration for daily use.

## Pros.
* It contains a autocomplete plugin that can autocomplete a lot languages source file.
* It contains a status bar from Airline plugin with surprisingly beautiful.

## Installation
Clone this repository and run `install.sh`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zlicdt/twinkle-vim-config.git
cd twinkle-vim-config
./install.sh
```

It would be done.

But in order to be able to use Airline theme normally, you should change the terminal font to a powerline font.

Powerline fonts has been installed with the script just now, just switch to one of them.
